# scroll-bbc-news
This is a Python program I've been working on for the Raspberry Pi to scroll news on the Scrollphat HD.

History
Some time ago I wrote a Python program to use the BBC RSS feed to get the news headlines and display them on my Raspberry Pi. It was one of many I experimented with when learning Python.
I recently bought some physical devices from Pimoroni to add to my Pi and BBC micro:bit so I thought I'd resurrect some old programs.
This one scrolls the headlines on the Pimoroni ScrollPhat HD that I got.

Files
get_bbc_news_headlines - this was the early file that used Python to display the headlines from the BBC RSS feed.
scroll_bbcnews - this uses the technniques I learnt in the older program and adapts it for the Pi and makes use of the Pimoroni Scroll Phat HD.
